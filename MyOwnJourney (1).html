            <p>I arrived in Singapore in <strong>April 2022</strong> ,  carrying the dreams I had promised my father and the hope of reclaiming the things we had to sell when my mother passed away. </p>
            <p>Courage and prayer were the only resources I had.I fought against loneliness and longing, replacing them with hard work and perseverance. </p>
            <p>I worked as a full-time domestic helper while also taking on an online job during my resting hours to pay off debts and support my family’s needs.</p>
            <p>I was grateful to have ended up with an employer who treated me like a human being.</p>
            <p>In 2023, my father was diagnosed with kidney disease, just as I was beginning to fulfill my promise of buying land for him.</p>
            <p> I set my dreams aside because, for me, my father was the only one we had left—he was more important than anything. And I never regretted that decision. I love my family deeply. We may not have grown up in luxury, but we were raised with love and proper guidance.</p>
            <p>My father’s battle with his illness was not easy. There were days when I wanted to go home, to care for him, hug him, and show him that I was there for him. But I channeled everything into prayer. No matter how much I wanted to return, I chose instead to support him by ensuring he had his medications, hoping to extend his life.</p>
            <p>In <strong>August 2024</strong>, he was rushed to the hospital for the last time. I could feel his struggle, and I saw in his eyes that he was tired. That was when I decided to go home to see him. But when my plane landed in the Philippines, I received a message from my sibling saying that my father had passed away. It was incredibly painful for me—I didn’t even get to see him breathing one last time or tell him in person how much I loved him and my mother.</p>
            <p>At that moment, I felt like I couldn’t go on. I didn’t know where to start again or how to continue the dreams I had built for them.</p>
            <p>I took care of everything and fulfilled my father’s last wish—to be laid to rest beside my mother.</p>
            <p>In September 2023, I returned to Singapore, feeling empty. I didn’t know what the future held or where to begin again. Once more, prayer became my only refuge.</p>
            <p>Being an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) became my way of understanding the true meaning of life. Being poor or whatever status we have in life is never a hindrance to success. Though my parents are no longer with me, they remain my greatest inspiration as I walk this path.</p>
            <p>One day, I will leave Singapore, but I will carry with me all the memories—both painful and joyful. This country taught me to dream again and helped me discover the truest version of myself. I have come far, but there is still a long road ahead. I Can do it  because I am a Filipino.</p>
